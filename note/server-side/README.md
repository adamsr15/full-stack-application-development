# Server-Side Programming with Express

## Getting Started with Express

Express is a web framework built atop the Node.js HTTP module. It is fast, unopinionated, and minimalist. It is 
distributed via an NPM package. It should be installed locally rather than globally. 

Express provides support for routing and serving static files. Almost all other functionality is provided by third-party 
middleware modules: processing request body via body parser; working with cookies via cookie parser; using session via 
Express sessions; and handling authentication via Passport.

A simple Express 'hello world' application can be found [here](https://github.com/muzzarellimj/full-stack-application-development/tree/main/note/server-side/hello-world).
